# Timestamp Microservice Project
This is a [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org) project for the **"Back End Development And APIs"** certification.

**It's a project for educational purposes**

## Installation

If you want to try for yourself, just clone this repository on your local:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/DEC25/timestamp-microservice-fcc timestamp
```
>Note: The created folder is called `timestamp`. If you want to leave the original name, just take the last argument off from the command above.

After that, you have to go to the created folder and install all the dependencies:

``` bash
cd ./timestamp
npm install
```
## Running the project
Finally, just run the server. You can do it in normal mode or dev mode:

- Normal mode
``` bash
npm start
```

- Dev mode
``` bash
npm run dev
```
>The dev mode allows you to reload the project automatically when you save changes on the code without having to finish the server process. Using `nodemon` package
